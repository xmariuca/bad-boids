Refactoring smells:

- raw numbers appear in the code 
=> replace magic numbers with constants
commit: 068564f

- fragments of repeated code appear
=> replace the repeated code with functions
commit:

- code needs a comment to explan what it does
=> change of a variable name
commit:

- an expression becomes too long
=> separate the lines into local variables
commit:

- loop vairable is an integer from 1 to something
=> replace loop with iterator
commit:

- someone else had done this before
=> replace hand-written code with library code
commit:

- a function needs to work corresponding indices of several arrays
=> replace set of arrays with array of structures
commit:

- you need to change your code file to explore different research scenarios
=> replace constants with a configuration file
commit:

- a global variable is assigned and then used inside a called function
=> replace global variables with function arguments
commit:

- two neighbouring loops have the same for statement
=> merge neighbouring loops
commit:

- a function or subroutine no longer fits on a page in your editor 
- a line of code is indented more than three levels 
- a piece of code interacts with the surrounding code through just a few variables
=> break a larger function into smaller units
commit:

- code difficult to locate
- version control conflicts
=> separate code concepts into files or modules
